### 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m Axelvyrn – a student of science, a builder of systems that predict human behavior, and a seeker of patterns hidden in plain sight.

I create tools that read between the lines, question the default, and harness computation to reflect on consciousness itself.

A crypto enthusiast with a creative knack for designing compelling content — from visuals and videos to websites and UI flows. I build with both code and aesthetics in mind.

### 🔮 Featured Project

#### 🚀 [TiresiasIQ](https://github.com/axelvyrn/tiresiasiQ) – The Behavior Prediction Engine

A personal and contextual neural network system that:

* Predicts your future actions based on past patterns
* Logs and analyzes behaviors via CLI and dashboard
* Understands time-sensitive triggers and habits
* Uses feedforward + LSTM networks with natural language interpretation

> “Know thyself, and thou shalt know the gods and the universe.”
> — Inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi

### Tech Stack

* **Python**, PyTorch, TensorFlow
* **Streamlit**, CLI UX, Jupyter
* **HTML/CSS/JS** for interfaces
* **Git**, **VS Code**, **Linux** workflows
* Currently exploring: `Web3`, `NOSTR`, `Neuro-symbolic AI`

---

### Current Focus

* Building TiresiasIQ v2 with natural language understanding
* Training LSTMs to reason like metaphorical minds
* Building minimal sat-stacking dashboards (Bitcoin focused)
* Researching dark psychology & social pattern engineering

### Philosophical Alignment

> *"Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself."*
> — Jean-Paul Sartre

I believe:

* **Predictability is the shadow of freedom** – understand it, and you're free from it.
* **Conscious automation** can enhance human life, not replace it.
* The map **is not the territory**, but a well-drawn one reveals more than meets the eye.
